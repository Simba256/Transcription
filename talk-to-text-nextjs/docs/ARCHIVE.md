# Archive - Initial Planning Documents

This folder contains the original planning documents from project inception. These are kept for reference but are superseded by the current documentation.

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

The original planning documents have been superseded by:
1. **Real Implementation**: The actual codebase now reflects completed work
2. **Updated Progress Tracking**: PROGRESS.md contains accurate, up-to-date status
3. **Current Planning**: STAGE_5_OPTIONS.md contains current decision points

These archived documents remain available for reference but should not be used for current development decisions.
