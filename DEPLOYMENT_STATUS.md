  - Proper user isolation and field validation
  - Allows all required fields for transcription documents

- **Storage Rules**: ✅ Deployed and working
  - File upload path: `/transcriptions/{userId}/`
  - Size limit: 100MB
  - Audio/video file types only

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### 1. Cross-User Access Security (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Users could create transcriptions for other users
- **Solution**: Updated Firestore rules with proper field validation using `hasOnly()`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

### 2. Speechmatics Processing Errors (RESOLVED)

- **Solution**: Aligned rules with `/transcriptions/{userId}/` path
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
1. **Environment Variables** (Required):
   ```env
   # Copy to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=transcription-a1b5a.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=transcription-a1b5a
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=transcription-a1b5a.appspot.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   
   # Optional - for Speechmatics integration
   SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY=your_speechmatics_key
   SPEECHMATICS_API_URL=https://asr.api.speechmatics.com/v2
   ```

### Testing Steps
1. **Test Configuration**:
   - Visit: `/api/test-config`
   - Check: Firebase connection, environment variables, Speechmatics status

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Login with demo accounts:
     - `user@demo.com` / `demo123`
     - `admin@demo.com` / `demo123`

3. **Test File Upload**:
   - Go to `/upload`
   - Upload an audio/video file (< 100MB)
   - Check: File saves to correct path, transcription record created

4. **Test Security Isolation**:
   - Login as different users
   - Verify: Users can only see their own transcriptions

5. **Test Speechmatics (Optional)**:
   - If API key configured: Should process automatically
   - If no API key: Should show "Manual Review" status
