RISKS AND MITIGATION
====================

LOW RISK:
- Core transcription workflow (existing and functional)
- Payment integration (Stripe implementation present)
- PDF locking (fully implemented)
- Basic templates (good foundation)

MEDIUM RISK:
- File system changes (requires careful migration)
- SCSS conversion (may impact existing styling)
- Document merging (new functionality)

HIGH RISK:
- WHC deployment compatibility (platform-specific dependencies)
- Performance with increased complexity
- Data migration if switching persistence layers

CONCLUSION
==========

The existing codebase provides an excellent foundation for Talk to Text Canada, with approximately 75% of required functionality already implemented. The core transcription workflow, payment processing, and security features are production-ready.

Key advantages of reusing this codebase:
‚úÖ Proven Speechmatics integration
‚úÖ Complete trial system implementation
‚úÖ Robust security measures
‚úÖ Clean, maintainable code structure
‚úÖ Flask best practices followed

Primary development focus should be on:
1. Project management system (new)
2. Intake CRUD operations (new)
3. LegalScript Studio interface (new)
4. File system structure expansion (modification)
5. Advanced dashboard features (enhancement)

Timeline Impact: Using this codebase reduces development time from 19 weeks to approximately 12-14 weeks, representing a 25-35% time savings while maintaining code quality and security standards.

RECOMMENDATION: Proceed with reusing this codebase as the foundation for Talk to Text Canada development.
